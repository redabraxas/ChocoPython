Monica: There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!

Monica: Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.

Monica: And they weren't looking at you before?!

Monica: Are you okay, sweetie?

Monica: (explaining to the others) Carol moved her stuff out today. 

Monica: (to Ross) Let me get you some coffee.

Monica: No you don't.

Monica: Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:A.M., "I'll never have grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren." was what?  A wrong number?

Monica: Rachel?!

Monica: (pointing at Rachel) De-caff. (to All) Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. (to Rachel) This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross? 

Monica: So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?

Monica: Who wasn't invited to the wedding.
