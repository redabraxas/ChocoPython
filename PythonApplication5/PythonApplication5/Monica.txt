 There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!
 Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.
 And they weren't looking at you before?!
 Are you okay, sweetie?
 (explaining to the others) Carol moved her stuff out today.
 (to Ross) Let me get you some coffee.
 No you don't.
 Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3 A.M., "I'll never have grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren." was what?  A wrong number?
 Rachel?!
 (pointing at Rachel) De-caff. (to All) Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. (to Rachel) This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?
 So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?
 Who wasn't invited to the wedding.
